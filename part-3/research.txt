The LinkedIn breach in June of 2021 did not include login credentials. However, it did include a variety of other valuable information including full names, phone numbers, home addresses, email addresses, geolocation records, username and profile URLs, personal and professional experiences and backgrounds, and other social media accounts and usernames of over 700 million users. The hacker going by the name of "God User", used data scraping techniques by exploiting LinkedIn's API. Although no super valuable information was taken, the data that was scraped allowed would-be malicious actors more than enough information to forge convincing social engineering attacks. After the attack, LinkedIn posted an update in which they "work to stop (the attackers) accountable."
